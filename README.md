# Daka

macOS menu bar tracker for recording the first and last time a configurable rule matches each day.

## Run

```bash
swift run daka
```

## Install with Homebrew

```bash
brew install iBreaker/daka/daka
brew services start daka
```

To stop it:

```bash
brew services stop daka
```

For a direct local start in release mode:

```bash
./scripts/daka-launcher.sh
```

To install it as a login startup item and start it immediately:

```bash
./scripts/install-autostart.sh
```

To remove the login startup item:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall-autostart.sh
```

The app stores data in SQLite on first launch:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Daka/daka.sqlite
```

Older `config.json` and `records.json` files are imported into SQLite automatically.

## Behavior

Daka does not calculate active-only time. It records:

```text
firstMatchedAt = today's first time the rule matched
lastMatchedAt  = today's latest time the rule matched
duration       = lastMatchedAt - firstMatchedAt
```

If the rule is unmatched in the middle of the day, that gap is not subtracted.

When the rule matches for the first time each day, Daka asks you to confirm that you have clocked in. The first time is written only after you click `已打卡`. Choosing `稍后提醒` delays the next reminder.

Daka compares today's duration with a configurable daily target. The default target is `10.5` hours.

Configuration and statistics are edited through the menu bar UI. SQLite is the storage layer, not the user-facing interface.

## UI

Menu bar actions:

```text
配置...   Open the rule editor
统计...   Open daily records
退出      Quit the menu bar app
```

The config UI supports:

```text
Rule name
Match mode: all / any
Evaluation interval
Daily target hours
Monthly average target hours
Weekly target hours
Rest-day reminder on/off
Rest-day reminder times
Rest-day reminder messages
Add/remove conditions
Condition parameters
Wi-Fi SSID selection from nearby/current networks
```

The menu shows today's progress with a progress bar and a colored status marker:

```text
red     under 40%
orange  40% - 74%
blue    75% - 99%
green   complete
```

## Storage

Config is stored in `app_config`; daily records are stored in `daily_records`. The default config is:

```json
{
  "evaluationIntervalSeconds": 60,
  "targetDurationSeconds": 37800,
  "rule": {
    "name": "Default",
    "matchMode": "all",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "type": "screenUnlocked"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Supported condition types:

```json
{ "type": "screenUnlocked" }
{ "type": "wifiConnected", "ssid": "Company WiFi" }
{ "type": "powerConnected" }
{ "type": "networkReachable", "host": "intranet.company.local", "port": 443 }
{ "type": "timeRange", "start": "08:00", "end": "20:00" }
```

Example:

```json
{
  "evaluationIntervalSeconds": 60,
  "rule": {
    "name": "Office",
    "matchMode": "all",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "type": "screenUnlocked"
      },
      {
        "type": "wifiConnected",
        "ssid": "Company WiFi"
      },
      {
        "type": "powerConnected"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Use `配置...` from the menu bar to edit and save the rule.

## Monthly Workday Statistics

The statistics window includes a `月度` tab. It calculates each natural month's average duration across China workdays.

China workdays are loaded from the public `holiday-calendar` CN JSON data and cached locally:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Daka/ChinaCalendar/
```

If a year cannot be loaded yet, Daka temporarily falls back to Monday-Friday for that year. Missing workday records count as `0m`, and the current month is calculated only up to today.

## Rest-Day Reminder

Daka can warn when the current China workweek has not reached the configured weekly target and a rest day is near:

```text
Last workday before a rest day: shows the rest-day reminder after its configured time
Day before the last workday: shows the day-before reminder after its configured time
```

Both reminder times and messages are editable in `配置...`. Each reminder is shown only once per day. The reminder includes total weekly duration, average duration per elapsed China workday, weekly target, and remaining duration.

## Test

```bash
swift test
```
